        <hr> <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
            I am Dalanphop Keawsiripong, a dedicated undergraduate student majoring in Software Engineering at the College of Arts, Media and Technology (CAMT), Chiang Mai University. My academic journey is driven by a profound interest in technology and software development. I am particularly fascinated by backend development, database management, and the potential of Artificial Intelligence to solve real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the classroom, I enjoy exploring new programming languages like Java and Python, and I am currently diving into web development standards. I believe that strong logical thinking comes from diverse interests, which is why I also enjoy analyzing complex narratives in novels and strategy games in my free time.
        </p>
        <p>
            After graduation, my primary goal is to become a professional Software Engineer or a Cybersecurity Specialist. I aim to work in a dynamic environment where I can contribute to innovative projects and secure digital infrastructures. I am eager to apply my skills in a practical setting, constantly learning and adapting to the ever-evolving tech landscape to become a valuable asset to the industry.
        </p>
